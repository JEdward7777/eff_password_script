# eff_password_script

This is yet another unoffical script which allows one to generate a random password from the [great eff password list](https://www.eff.org/dice) inspired by the [diceware password list](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).  A script is needed because one shouldn't really trust an online website to generate a password and rolling dice by hand to generate a password takes time.  Here are steps for using this tool.
1. Install python 3 if it isn't installed already
1. Clone this repo.
1. Look through the code and satisfy to yourself that it doesn't phone home.  (Or run the code on a PC with a live disk with no hard drives and no internet connection...)
1. Run the scrypt with python.
1. Decide if you are good with fake random numbers or grab true random numbers from random.org
1. Use the produced password which is easier to remember then random characters and wasn't picked out by a human.
1. Eat a muffin and congratulate yourself on good password choices and consider using a password manager like [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
